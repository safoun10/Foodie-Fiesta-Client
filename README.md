### Some of the best features of my site is ðŸ˜ƒ

- My website is dedicated to one specific cuisine (**Japanese**).
- The name of the website appears in the title and on the navbar.
- The navbar is present on all pages and includes the website name, Home, Blog, and User profile picture. The Login button appears when the user is not signed in, and the user's name is displayed when hovering over the profile picture.
- The footer is present on all pages and is reasonable and I tried to make it meaningful.
- The Login page has options for email/password login, Google Sign-in, and GitHub Sign-in, as well as a link to the registration page.
- The Registration page has fields for name, email, password, and photo URL. Errors are displayed for invalid email or password or for a password that is too short ( pass < 6 ) .
> Empty email/password fields can't go through submission.
- The homepage includes a banner section with text and images, as well as a Chef section with at least six cards that display information about each chef, such as their picture, name, years of experience, number of recipes, likes, and a View Recipes button. There are also two additional meaningful sections on the homepage.
- Clicking the View Recipes button redirects the user to the Chef Recipes page, which includes a banner with the chef's picture, name, bio/description, likes, number of recipes, and years of experience. The page also displays the selected chef's recipes in a card group, with information such as recipe name, ingredients, cooking method, rating, and a Favorite button. Clicking the Favorite button shows a toast message and disables the button.
- A spinner is displayed while the data is loading. 
- There is a 404 page with a picture.
- The Firebase config keys are hidden using environment variables.
- The active route is indicated by border- bottom.
- The website (*most of it*) is mobile and desktop responsive.
- There is a blogs page that includes answers to specific questions about React That was asked in the requirements.
- The Chef Recipe page is private and does not redirect the user to the login page upon reload.
- ~~The chef pictures on the banner of Chef Recipes or on the six cards on the Homepage are lazy- loaded.~~
- There is a button on the blog page that generates and downloads a PDF containing information about the page.
- The website design and color selection are reasonable and meaningful (*I tried to make it but my design sense is as bad as my gpaðŸ™‚*)
- The code is clean and organized with meaningful names.
