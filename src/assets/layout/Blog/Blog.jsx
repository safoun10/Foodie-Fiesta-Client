						What is the Difference Between a Controlled and
						Uncontrolled Component in React?
					</div>
					<div className="title-text fs-5">
						In React, there are two types of components:{" "}
						<b>controlled</b> and <b>uncontrolled</b>. Uncontrolled
						components refer to those where the browser or an
						external component manages the state. For instance, a
						basic HTML input element is an uncontrolled component in
						React because it takes care of its own state. These
						components are used for simple inputs where the
						application doesn't need to keep track of the state.
						<br />
						<br />
						Controlled components, on the other hand, are components
						where the application manages the state using the state
						or props objects. For example, a React input component
						that updates its value based on the application's state
						is a controlled component. These components offer more
						precise control over how the component behaves and
						looks. Controlled components are usually used for more
						complex user interactions.
						<br />
						<br />
						Controlled components manage state through props, making
						them predictable but complex in large projects.
						Uncontrolled components manage their own state with
						refs, making them simpler but harder to track.
						Uncontrolled components are also difficult to test
						because internal state is not visible.

						In web development, components refer to the building
						blocks of user interfaces. They can be either controlled
						or uncontrolled. Controlled components are those whose
						values are controlled by the parent component, while
						uncontrolled components manage their own state.
						Understanding the differences between the two is
						important for building efficient and maintainable web
						applications.
						<br />
						<br />
						Uncontrolled components are simpler to use and require
						less code, as they manage their own state internally.
						They are commonly used for simple forms that do not
						require validation or complex input handling. However,
						uncontrolled components can cause unexpected behavior
						and are harder to test. Also, they don't support
						server-side rendering and can cause performance issues
						when used in larger applications.
						<br />
						<br />
						On the other hand, controlled components give developers
						more control over the behavior of the application. They
						are particularly useful for complex forms that require
						input validation or dynamic input handling. Controlled
						components can be tested more easily and support
						server-side rendering. However, they require more code
						and can be more difficult to implement.
						<br />
						<br />
						In conclusion, choosing between controlled and
						uncontrolled components depends on the specific needs of
						the application. For simple forms, uncontrolled
						components may be sufficient, while for more complex
						forms and larger applications, controlled components are
						usually preferred. Developers should weigh the benefits
						and drawbacks of each approach to determine the best fit
						for their particular use case.

						What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js ?
					</div>
					<div className="title-text fs-5">
						Node.js and Express.js are two popular technologies used
						in web development. While Node.js is a JavaScript
						runtime environment that allows developers to run
						JavaScript code on the server-side, Express.js is a web
						application framework that is built on top of Node.js
						and provides a set of features for building web
						applications.
						<br />
						<br />
						Node.js provides a platform for executing JavaScript on
						the server-side, which enables developers to write
						server-side code using the same language as the
						client-side code. Node.js provides features like
						event-driven, non-blocking I/O that make it efficient
						for handling high-traffic web applications. Node.js can
						be used for a variety of server-side tasks, including
						building APIs, handling file uploads, and processing
						data.
						<br />
						<br />
						Express.js, on the other hand, is a lightweight web
						application framework that simplifies the process of
						building web applications using Node.js. It provides a
						set of features, such as routing, middleware, and
						template engines, that make it easier to build scalable
						and maintainable web applications. Express.js is
						designed to work with Node.js and leverages its features
						to provide an efficient and easy-to-use web development
						platform.

						building web applications using Node.js. Node.js is
						suitable for a variety of server-side tasks, while
						Express.js is designed specifically for building web
						applications. Both technologies are widely used in web
						development and offer unique advantages depending on the
						specific needs of the project.

						What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom
						hook ?
					</div>
					<div className="title-text fs-5">
						React is a popular JavaScript library used for building
						user interfaces. Custom hooks are a powerful feature of
						React that allows developers to reuse logic across
						multiple components. A custom hook is simply a
						JavaScript function that uses the built-in hooks
						provided by React, such as useState or useEffect, to
						encapsulate and reuse a specific piece of logic.
						<br />
						<br />
						Creating a custom hook can provide several benefits.
						First, it can help reduce code duplication and make the
						codebase more maintainable. Custom hooks can be shared
						across multiple components, allowing developers to
						centralize the logic and avoid repeating the same code
						in different places. Second, custom hooks can help
						improve the readability of the code. By abstracting away
						complex logic into a custom hook, developers can make
						the code more modular and easier to understand.
						<br />
						<br />
						Developers can create custom hooks for a wide range of
						use cases. For example, a custom hook could be created
						to handle form validation, authentication, or data
						fetching. By encapsulating this logic in a custom hook,
						developers can easily reuse the same code across
						multiple components, reducing the amount of boilerplate
						code required in each component.
